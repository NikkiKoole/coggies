// how to describe an animation?
// body animations are build from parts
// leg sprite
// body sprite
// left arm sprite
// right arm sprite
// head sprite

// sprites have atleast an orientation (north/east/south/west)
// a frame also has a notion which part to draw in front of which other part eg:
// when walking to the east, the right arm is visible on top of the body, the left arm is below
// when walking west its the opposite.

// also poses have a root thats on the floor (the handle which is being moved) the feet dont neccesaaryly are here, best example, when sprinting a pose could have both feet in the air, but the handle will always remian on the floor, I need to know the offset to that handle from some point
// speaking of which, i also need to know what point to attach the other part to.
// and I might want to have extra handles for where the hands are, so i can attach some object to them.


// the draw order is always the same when facing east/west/north or south. so no need to complex this further.


pose = {
    order:[left arm, torso, right arm] // [right arm, torso, left arm]
    head:{frame:}
    torso:{frame:"img123"}
    left_arm:{}
    right_arm:{}
    legs:{}
}
